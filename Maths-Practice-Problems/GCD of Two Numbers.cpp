Example
Example 1:
Input:
a = 28, b = 35

Output:
7

Explanation:

The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
The factors of 35 are 1, 5, 7, 35
The largest common factor is 7.
Example 2:
Input:
a = 18, b = 48

Output:
6

Explanation:

The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.
The factors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48.
The largest common factor is 6.
Note
You need to ensure that your solution handles values of a and b that are up to 10^6 efficiently.

Example 1:

Input:

Input: a = 4, b = 5

Output:
